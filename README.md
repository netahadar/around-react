In this project I've specialized in: 
  * React foundations (imports, components, JSX etc.)
  * React DevTools
  * React hooks
  * Controled and uncontroled components
  * Working with Forms
  * States
  * Components life cycle 
  * React router
  * Lifting / drilling state
  * Context
  * Ref
  * Debugging
  And more...
